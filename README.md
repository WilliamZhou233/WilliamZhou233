### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the New Era for Legal Research

Standing in the intersection of law and machine learning, I believe the research of economic analysis of law in our times has come to a turning point. I'd like to explore a promising field of legal research based on natural language process(NLP) that create a new paradigm leveraging on such advanced AI-assisted tools especially for text processing, to bridge law and NLP in a unified framework.
