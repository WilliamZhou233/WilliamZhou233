### Hi there 👋

🎉 My name is Ziyue Zhou, welcome to the new era for legal research!

👨‍🎓 I am a Ph.D. student at the Faculty of Law in the University of Hong Kong. I obtained my Bachelor of Laws degree (LL.B.) from Peking University in July 2021, and Master of Laws degree (LL.M.) from the University of Chicago In June 2022.

🤖 With the progress in artificial intelligence, I believe the legal research in our time has come to a turning point. Recent technological development in natural language process(NLP) and machine learning(ML) has created new possibilites for empirical legal studies. Many new fields and topics deserve exploration. That's a huge opportunity for a new generation of young legal scholars. Let's keep moving forward!
