### Hi there 👋

🎉 My name is William Zhou, welcome to the new era for legal research!

👨‍🎓 I obtained my Master of Laws degree(LLM) from the University of Chicago In June 2022. https://www.law.uchicago.edu/

Nowadays, standing in the intersection of law and machine learning, I believe the research of economic analysis of law in our times has come to a turning point. I'd like to explore a promising field of legal research based on natural language process(NLP) that create a new paradigm leveraging on such advanced AI-assisted tools especially for text processing, to bridge law and NLP in a unified framework.
